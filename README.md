# Virtual-Museum

This build is the final version of the game. Sadly I can't post the source files.

This project was created for IT competition. The idea came from a friend of mine. After talking with the local museum staff, they have agred to let me take pictures of the whole building
in order to create this project. The idea is, this project to be available for every person inside the country who want to check out the museum but have no time or funds to do so, also everything is on bulgarian.

If you want to play it. 

You need to use W, A, S, D and the Mouse to be able to move. When you go near the entrance of the building or near the entrance of another floor press the button E.
When an objects become outlined with red color press the left mouse button to get the information for the given room you're in. 
To be able to talk with the guy walking around go close to him and press the button E to talk with him. Than click on one of the buttons get the information about the given room.
Than he will start walking towards the given room. After reaching his goal, he will stop and start giving a shorten version of the infromation given on the wall object. 
After finishing he will start walking around until you call him again.
